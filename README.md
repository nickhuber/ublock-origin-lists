## Intro

This is a small collection of some uBlock Origin lists that I feel help make
the internet slightly more tolerable to browse. I've broken it into components
to try and help any other users only use a part they may care about.

## LLMs

I got tired of seeing the stolen works of humanity being resold without
attribution, a feature some call LLM or AI. The
[ai-things.txt](./ai-things.txt) list tries to remove all references to these
systems while leaving the rest of the website in a working state.

## Advertising

Maybe some companies like to think of this as showing a new feature, product or
recent change but I see it as an advertisement like any other. The list
[advertisements.txt](advertisements.txt) tries to remove all of these annoying
notifications from applications. These are a little harder to find because
sometimes they only show 1 time and sometimes you can't see them until you've
been using the product for a while to have a new feature released that the
company wants to promote.
